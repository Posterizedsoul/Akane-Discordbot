Help cog has been removed because it was causing some weird problems. Add your own if you want to host this bot.

All the scraping scripts are/will-be available in Fluby repository.
Switched to API's instead of scrapping everything on my own.

This bot is entirely written in Discord.py and shall be entirely re-written in other libraries(if I am not lazy) possibly with hikari/nextcord/pycord.
Warning this bot was written for my personal use in my server so some functionality has been removed before uploading it to github.
